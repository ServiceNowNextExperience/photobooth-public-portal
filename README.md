# photobooth-public-portal

Public portal for end users to interact with their snapshots (share, delete, etc.)

This application supports the *ServiceNow Photobooth App* at [https://github.com/ServiceNowNextExperience/photobooth](https://github.com/ServiceNowNextExperience/photobooth)

## Dependencies
This application requires the [Photobooth Core](https://github.com/ServiceNowNextExperience/photobooth-core) application, which contains the supporting records for snapshots and requests.

However, going to the main Photobooth repo and installing the dependencies listed there is probably a good idea.
